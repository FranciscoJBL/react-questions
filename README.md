# Question React Frontend

This project is an example front end for https://github.com/FranciscoJBL/questionsapi

## Installation

For instalation, clone this repository, then install the dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FranciscoJBL/react-questions
cd react-questions
npm install
```

## Usage

Run Api:

```bash
npm start
```

Then, open in your navigator http://localhost:3000. (React should open it for you)

You can answer the questions made by the api, using the options provided. 
All your data and preferences will be saved by the api, then you can call (WIP) http://localhost:3000/userid in order to retrieve this information.

### TODO:
- Styling
- Show client data page (Using react router?)
- Create message form (Using react router?)
- Header should be material one instead of just html
